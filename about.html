            <p>
              I am Kristina (Христина), an artist currently based in Leuven,
              Belgium. I work primarily in oil on canvas, with a focus on quiet,
              intimate interiors and fragments of everyday life.
            </p>
            <p>
              My paintings often return to the same objects, corners and light
              sources — a chair, a window, a tablecloth — tracing how they
              change with time, mood and memory. Colour and atmosphere are as
              important to me as the subject itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Originally from [your origin, if you wish to mention], I studied
              [any studies, or “I am self-taught”] and have been developing this
              body of work over the past years while living in different cities.
            </p>
